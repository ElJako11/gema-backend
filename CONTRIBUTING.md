# CONTRIBUTIONS

Guidelines for contributions to the project

## COMMITS

- Each commit message must be descriptive and clear.
- Use conventional commits
  - feat: Add new feature
  - fix: fix bug
  - chore: update dependencies
  - refactor: Internal code restructuring

## BRANCHES

- Main branch contains stable releases for production
- Develop branch is the development branch, for new features and bug fixes.
- Each brand must be named according to the feature or bug it is addressing, eg: feat/add-new-feature, fix/fix-bug, chore/update-dependencies, etc.

** Order of branches: **
`main` <- `develop` <- `feat/add-new-feature` | `fix/fix-bug` | `chore/update-dependencies`
